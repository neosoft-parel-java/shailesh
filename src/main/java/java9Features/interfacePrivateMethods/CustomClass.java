    * Since java 9, you will be able to add private methods and private static method in interfaces.

    * These private methods will improve code re-usability inside interfaces.
    For example, if two default methods needed to share code, a private interface method
    would allow them to do so, but without exposing that private method to itâ€™s implementing classes.

    * Using private methods in interfaces have four rules :
        -- Private interface method cannot be abstract.
        -- Private method can be used only inside interface.
        -- Private static method can be used inside other static and non-static interface methods.
        -- Private non-static methods cannot be used inside private static methods.
