    /*
    * Till Java 8, String in java were internally represented by char[].
    * Each char is stored in 2 bytes in memory. JDK developers at oracle analyzed
    * lots of clientâ€™s application heap dumps and they noticed that most of the strings can be represented
    * only using Latin-1 characters set. A latin-1 char can be stored in one byte, which is 50% (1 byte)
    * less than char data type storage.

    * So, the JDK developers defaulted the String classes internal storage to byte[] from char[].
    * This has resulted in saving of lots of space in heap memory because string objects
    * take up really big portion of heap memory, generally. [Source]

    * You can control the usage of this feature in your application using
    * -XX:-CompactStrings parameters to java command.
